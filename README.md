# Movie Recommendation System

## Introduction
This project implements a movie recommendation system using data from the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset. The system suggests similar movies based on user input and utilizes content-based filtering techniques.

## Files

- **main.py**: Python script containing the code for the movie recommendation system.
- **tmdb_5000_movies.csv**: Dataset containing information about movies such as title, genre, keywords, etc.
- **tmdb_5000_credits.csv**: Dataset containing information about movie credits, including cast and crew details.
Certainly! Let's break down the data and preprocessing steps in the provided code:

### Data
The data used in this project comes from two CSV files:

1. **tmdb_5000_movies.csv**: This dataset contains information about movies. Some of the important columns include:
   - `budget`: Budget of the movie.
   - `genres`: Genres associated with the movie.
   - `keywords`: Keywords/tags related to the movie.
   - `title`: Title of the movie.
   - `overview`: Brief overview or summary of the movie.
   
2. **tmdb_5000_credits.csv**: This dataset contains information about movie credits, including cast and crew details. Important columns include:
   - `movie_id`: Unique identifier for the movie.
   - `title`: Title of the movie.
   - `cast`: Information about the cast members.
   - `crew`: Information about the crew members.
   
### Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps involve cleaning and preparing the data for further analysis. Here's what happens:

1. **Data Loading**: The CSV files are read into Pandas DataFrames (`movies` and `credits`).

2. **Data Merging**: The `credits` DataFrame is merged with the `movies` DataFrame using the `title` column as the key. This combines the information about movies and their credits into a single DataFrame.

3. **Column Selection**: Only a subset of columns is retained in the merged DataFrame (`movies`). The selected columns include:
   - `genres`
   - `id`
   - `keywords`
   - `title`
   - `overview`
   - `cast`
   - `crew`
   
4. **Handling Missing Values**: Rows with missing values are dropped from the DataFrame using the `dropna()` function.

5. **Feature Engineering**: The `genres`, `keywords`, `cast`, and `crew` columns contain JSON-formatted strings. Functions are defined to extract relevant information from these columns and convert them into lists of strings.

6. **Tag Generation**: Tags are generated by combining information from the `genres`, `keywords`, `cast`, and `crew` columns into a single column named `tags`.

7. **Final Data Preparation**: The DataFrame is further cleaned by removing unnecessary columns (`genres`, `keywords`, `overview`, `cast`, and `crew`). The resulting DataFrame (`new`) contains only the `id`, `title`, and `tags` columns.

## Analysis

### Cosine Similarity Calculation

In this project, we utilized cosine similarity as a pivotal metric to quantify the resemblance between pairs of movies. Cosine similarity serves as a measure of similarity between two vectors in an n-dimensional space, computed as the cosine of the angle between them.

### Understanding Cosine Similarity

In the realm of movie recommendation systems, each movie is conceptualized as a vector within a multi-dimensional space. Each dimension of this space corresponds to a specific attribute or tag associated with the movie. For instance, genres, keywords, and cast members could all represent distinct dimensions in this space.

### Applying Cosine Similarity to Movie Recommendations

By computing the cosine similarity between pairs of movie vectors, we can assess their similarity based on their feature representations. Higher cosine similarity scores denote greater similarity between movies, while lower scores signify dissimilarity.

### Implementation in Recommendation System

Our recommendation system leverages these cosine similarity scores to suggest similar movies to a given input. By identifying movies with the highest cosine similarity scores to the input movie, the system can effectively recommend relevant movies that share similar features and characteristics.

### Significance of Cosine Similarity

The utilization of cosine similarity enables our recommendation system to provide personalized and relevant movie suggestions to users based on their preferences and viewing history. This enhances the overall user experience by facilitating the discovery of new movies that align with their interests.


## Libraries Used
- **numpy**: For numerical computing.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **ast**: For abstract syntax tree operations.
  
## How to Use
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install numpy pandas`.
3. Download the TMDB dataset files and place them in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the `main.py` script.

## Example Usage
```python
recommend("Avatar")
```





## Conclusion
In conclusion, this movie recommendation system demonstrates the implementation of content-based filtering techniques to suggest similar movies based on user preferences. By analyzing movie features such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew, the system effectively provides personalized recommendations. The system can be further enhanced by incorporating user feedback, collaborative filtering methods, or leveraging more advanced machine learning algorithms.
